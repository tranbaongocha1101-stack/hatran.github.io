# Skills

## Technical Expertise

**Mechanical System Design**  
Design and optimization of heavy industrial machinery and complex mechanical systems from concept through manufacturing and commissioning.

**Structural Analysis & Strength Assessment**  
Classical hand calculations and Finite Element Analysis (ANSYS) for static strength, load validation, and structural reliability under real operating conditions.

**Hydraulic System Integration**  
Hydraulic component selection, pipe routing, and performance validation for heavy equipment applications.

**Aero-Hydrodynamic Performance**  
Analytical and simulation-based evaluation of aerodynamic and hydrodynamic systems, including operation in turbulent and unsteady environments.

**Design for Manufacturability (DFM)**  
Development of fabrication drawings (including GD&T), supplier coordination, and cost-effective engineering solutions.
