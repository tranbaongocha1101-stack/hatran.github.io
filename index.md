## Ha Tran

### Mechanical Design Engineer | Heavy Industrial Machinery | Renewable Energy  | Aerospace, Mining & Marine Systems

I am a mechanical engineer with industry and research experience delivering complex mechanical systems across heavy industrial machinery, renewable energy, aerospace platforms, and marine engineering.

My background includes mechanical design, structural strength assessment, hydraulic system integration, aero-hydrodynamic performance analysis, and full product development from concept through manufacturing, testing, and commissioning. I have led redesign and optimization projects to improve reliability, reduce weight, lower centre of gravity, and enhance operational safety under real-world working conditions.

Holding New Zealand citizenship, I am open to industry opportunities locally and internationally in design, heavy equipment, mining-related machinery, energy systems, and advanced manufacturing.
