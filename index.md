### Mechanical Design Engineer | Heavy Industrial Machinery | Renewable Energy | Aerospace, Mining & Marine Systems

I am a Mechanical Engineer with combined industry and research experience delivering complex mechanical systems across heavy industrial machinery, renewable energy, aerospace platforms, and marine engineering.

I hold a **PhD and Master’s in Mechanical Engineering** from the University of Auckland, where my research translated into **high-impact engineering solutions**, including UAV aerodynamic performance under extreme wind conditions and tidal turbine hydrodynamics.

I excel in:

- **End-to-end engineering delivery** – from conceptual design to detailed engineering, manufacturing, and commissioning.  
- **Mechanical and hydraulic systems integration** – optimising reliability, performance, and maintainability.  
- **Simulation and analysis** – structural FEA, CFD, and experimental validation to inform design decisions.  
- **Supplier and stakeholder coordination** – including offshore manufacturing, fabrication, and commissioning support.  
- **Design for Manufacture & Assembly (DFMA)** – GD&T, fabrication drawings, and layout optimisation to reduce cost and improve reliability.

I combine **technical expertise** with practical problem-solving under real-world constraints, delivering projects that meet client requirements, comply with safety standards, and perform reliably in extreme environments.

As a New Zealand citizen, I am open to engineering opportunities both locally and internationally within design engineering, heavy equipment, mining machinery, energy systems, and advanced manufacturing sectors.
